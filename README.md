# Stochastic-Simulation-and-Gradient-Estimation

This software package aims at providing a tool for simulation of several benchmark stochastic system simulation, and performance gradient estimation

1. Queueing Systems
2. Inventory Systems
3. Stochastic Activity Networks

In all three cases, the LR (likelihood ratio), IPA (infinitesimal Perterbation Analysis) and WD (weak derivatives) methods are implemented.

A graphical user interface is provided to set up the simualation, and choose gradient estimation technique.

This package is still under development
